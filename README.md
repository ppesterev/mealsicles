# Mealsicles
A simple recipe app using the MealDB API, made with React as a learning project.

This project uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) for bundling. Install it globally:  
`npm i -g parcel-bundler`  
or as a local dependency:  
`npm i -D parcel-bundler`

Then just `npm run dev` to start a dev server, or `npm run build` to build for production.
